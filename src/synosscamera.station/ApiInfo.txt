API Definition
Every API will define the following items:

Name
It will go after “SYNO.XXX.YYY”. XXX will represent the application name, YYY will represent the feature
category. For example, SYNO.SurveillanceStation.Camera, SurveillanceStation means the API is
provided by the Surveillance Station, Camera means this API will retrieve the camera configurations.

URL path
Surveillance Station Web API does not preserve a constant URL for every API. Instead, 3rd party
applications need to use the command SYNO.API.Info to retrieve every API’s URL path. SYNO.API.Info is
the only API with constant URL, and it does not need authorization, its path is /webapi/query.cgi

Method
Every method is unique in its own API, and it has to be defined when you use the API. For example,
SYNO.SurveillanceStation.Camera API, call the method GetInfo will retrieve some camera
configurations.

Version
Surveillance Station Web API will require you designate an API version to ensure the result is within the
expectation. SYNO.API.Info will return every API’s supported versions. “Not supported version” will be
returned if API is not supported. We may drop the support on the old API version, make sure you keep
this in mind.
